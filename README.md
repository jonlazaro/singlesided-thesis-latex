One-paged thesis-latex
======================

Latex template for one-paged documents, based on [@unaguil](https://github.com/unaguil/)'s thesis-latex (https://github.com/unaguil/thesis-latex/).

Includes some class and useful macros for university deliveries (or any other one-paged documentation).

Changes from [@unaguil](https://github.com/unaguil/)'s thesis-latex:
* Removed blank pages.
* Changed the style of the cover.
* Same alignment for every page.
* Same header for every page (the title of the chapter).
* Removed -commented- thesis related stuff like: second cover, dedication, abstract, acknowledgement...

Tested with pdflatex.

There is a brief example of the template output [here](https://github.com/jonlazaro/onepaged-thesis-latex/blob/master/document.pdf).
